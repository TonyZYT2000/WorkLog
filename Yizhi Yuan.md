# PBD Simulation

## Week 2, 4/18 - 4/24

- On Monday, has finished a most basic Position-based Simulator.
- For now the simulator can take pointers to the position vectors of vertices to display, and change them in-place per simulation step.
- Currently Distance Constraint and Volume Constraint are implemented for testing. Next step will be to incorporate into Yutong's rendering repo. 
If it displays correctly, then will add Volumne Constraint and Shape Matching Constraint. 
- Finished implementing the position/velocity projection methods in the solver.
- Finished the .vtk FileLoader


## Week 1, 4/11 - 4/17

- Read the originial PBD Sovler paper. 
- Initialize the Solver C++ project. 
- Set up the Eigen dependency.
